# Attester guide

The vault stakes each subnet's alpha under the validators listed in
`ValidatorRegistry`. Those lists are set by attestations - EIP-712
messages signed off-chain by a quorum of registry signers. This guide is
for the people producing those signatures.

## What you are signing

One attestation sets the complete validator list for one subnet:

    struct WeightAttestation {
        uint256   netuid;    // the subnet the attestation applies to
        bytes32[] hotkeys;   // validators the vault stakes this subnet's alpha under
        uint256[] weights;   // each validator's share of the stake, in basis points
        uint256   nonce;     // orders this subnet's updates
        uint256   deadline;  // submission cutoff, unix seconds
    }

The registry enforces at submission time:

- 1 to 64 distinct, non-zero hotkeys, one weight per hotkey.
- Every weight non-zero; weights sum to exactly 10000.
- netuid fits in 16 bits.
- nonce equals `nonces(netuid) + 1`. Nonces count per subnet.
- The deadline is still in the future.

The EIP-712 domain:

    name:              "AlphaVault ValidatorRegistry"
    version:           "1"
    chainId:           the chain the registry is deployed on
    verifyingContract: the registry address

## Submitting

Anyone can submit - the signatures are the authorization, the sender only
pays gas. Call `updateValidators(attestation, signatures)` with at least
`threshold()` signatures over the same digest, ordered ascending by
signer address; the contract rejects any other order, and duplicate
signers with it. Extra signatures beyond the threshold are fine as long
as each comes from a current signer. `updateValidatorsBatch` takes
several attestations in one transaction, each with its own signature
list.

A successful update emits `ValidatorsUpdated(netuid, nonce, hotkeys,
weights)`.

## What happens after an update

The vault picks up the new set on its next deposit, alpha exit or
`rebalance` for that subnet; the TAO exit ignores the weights and sells
from wherever the stake sits. If a validator was dropped, the next such
call first rolls the vault's stake off it onto the current set; whoever
wants the stake realigned right away can call the vault's
`rebalance(netuid)`.

Deposits parked under a dropped hotkey stay recoverable: `wrap` refuses
out-of-set hotkeys up front, and stake already sitting in a mailbox
under one stays reclaimable by its owner.

## Hotkey renames

Watch the chain for hotkey swaps executed by the operators of attested
validators - the swap event names the old and new key. The vault
follows a single rename on its own and keeps operating on the
successor; re-attest the new hotkey in the old one's place at your
convenience to bring the registry back in line. When the vault cannot
follow (a second rename before it acted, or no rename record for that
subnet), the token's deposits and partial exits revert
`BackingShortfall` until you re-attest. Your attestation is the
recovery: it must name the keys that actually hold the backing, and
the forgiveness it authorizes covers exactly what those newly attested
keys hold. Until then the freeze is expected behavior, and
`isBackingIntact(tokenId)` is the signal to alert on.

## Signer set changes

The registry admin replaces the signer set with
`setSigners(newSigners, newThreshold)`: 2 to 16 signers, threshold at
least 2 and at most the signer count. The change emits `SignersUpdated`
and takes effect immediately, so signatures from a removed signer stop
counting even if collected earlier. The admin role administers itself -
an admin can add or remove admins - so whoever holds it ultimately
controls future signer sets.
